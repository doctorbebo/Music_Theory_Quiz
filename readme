The purpose of this assignment is to grow my skills as web developer. Principles studied in class were necessary for this project.
DOM manipulation was major portion of this project. However, a back track to previous skills were still required. This project help refine
and grow my skills in DOM manipulation via JavaScript. This project also presented some extra challenges which include having two scripts 
communicate with each other, loading pages based on buttons and saving info to local storage. All the elements of this project helped
progress my skills as a wed developer. 

There were several tools needed to complete this project. It started with git bash and git hub which created all of the files needed as 
well as store backups. I continually backed up all my code on git hub. I used html as the skeleton of the pages required for this. I 
used CSS as well for formatting and presentation. I also used five separate JavaScript files. Furthermore, with my codebase growing for
these, I implemented an alphabetized system to my code in order to easily find code written earlier that I needed to access. 

I learned a great deal with this project. What I learned most, is that I have a long way to go. I learned more about CSS. I learned more
about using console.log for debugging. I probably grew most in my ability to manipulate the DOM. Generating the test also taught me about
classes, objects, and arrays. Parent and child relations also became clearer. Finally handling frustrating circumstances is skill
I never thought I would use in programming.
